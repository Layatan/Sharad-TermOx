# Sharad-TermOx
W.I.P but a terminal shadowrun ttrpg sim heavily inspired / loose port of Pro-Halled's Sharad Ratatui.

Expected differenences:
Local AI pipeway to remove the need for open AI or any API key. hopefully lightweight enouh for potato pc's.
c++ yeah we're moving back in technology.

oh boi i sure hope termox is cross platform

Discontinued (FOR NOW) in favor of Ncurses version as idk how to TermOx yet and TermOx 2 is kinda light on documentation. STill nterested just not for active dev :/
N.E.way now developing this on: https://github.com/Layatan/Sharad-Ncurses
